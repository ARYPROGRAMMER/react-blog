## Getting Started ‚ö°
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Prerequisites ‚öô
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14.0 or higher recommended)
- **MongoDB** (for the database)

### Installation Steps üîç
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OkenHaha/react-blog.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-blog
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   cd front-end
   npm install
   
   cd ../back-end
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the database connection:
   - Copy your MongoDB connection URL.
   - Create a `.env` file in the `back-end` directory.
   - Add the following line to the `.env` file:
     ```env
     CONNECTION_URL="your-mongodb-connection-url"
     ```
     Example for local testing:
     ```env
     CONNECTION_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   npm run dev
   ```
   This command uses **concurrently** to run both frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

6. Open the application in your browser:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend: `http://localhost:5000`
