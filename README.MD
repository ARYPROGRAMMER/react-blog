# React Blog - Social Winter of Code 2024
I'm proud to present **React Blog** application which has been selected for SWOC-2024. Please go through the Contribution guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` on how you can contribute to this project. I hope everyone is excited to contribute and if you don't mind, make a star for this repo. Thanks

# Steps
- First you need to have and install NodeJs,preferrably versions > 14.0 and mongoDB also
- `cd` into both `front-end` and `back-end` directories and run `npm install` to install dependencies 
- Copy your database url link of the MongoDB database and replace the link to a .env file under the variable named **CONNECTION_URL** e.g. `CONNECTION_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017"` like this (for testing in local environment)
- `cd` into the **back-end** directory and run the command `npm run dev` (since it uses concurrently it runs both front end and backend scripts simultaneously)
