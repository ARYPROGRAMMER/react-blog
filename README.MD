# Blog Project using MERN stack
Decided to do a Blog project while learning the MERN Stack. I used vite for React. It utilized nodemon server so that it can run both front-end and backedn concurrently. Features can be added but for now adding comments to an article is a basic future at the moment. Will add more stuff in the mean time.

# Steps
- First you need to have and install NodeJs,preferrably versions > 14.0 and mongoDB also
- Copy your database url link of the MongoDB database and replace the link to a .env file under the variable named **CONNECTION_URL** e.g. `CONNECTION_URL = "mongodb://localhost:27017"` like this.
- Create a database inside MongoDB called **blog** and a collection named **articles** for the databse.
- `cd` into the **back-end** directory and run the command `npm run dev`   

## Tools Used:-
- TailwindCSS
- ExpressJS
