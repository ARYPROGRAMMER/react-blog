# Blog Project using MERN stack
Decided to do a Blog project while learning the MERN Stack. I used vite for React. I've set up the script so that the fron-end and back-end can run at the same time.

## Steps
- It's a MERN stack you should have all the requirements for it already.
- If the database is not created automatically, the database name is **blog**
- cd both into the fron-end and backend folder and run `npm install`
- now cd into the back-end folder and run `npm run dev`
